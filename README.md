# Maze Solver

This is a maze generator and solver created with Python and Tkinter. It was
created as part of a guided project on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/).

This program will animate generating a simple maze, and solving that maze, to
allow for visualization of the underlying algorithms.

# Running

## Pre-requisites

- python >= 3.10.12
- pip >= 24.1.1
- pipenv >= 2024.0.1

The maze solver can be run using `./main.sh`. Currently, the maze will generate
and solve a single time. To generate an additional maze, the program can be
closed and re-run.

# Tests

All unit tests can be executed using `./test.sh`
